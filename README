Used:
AWS CLI
Ansible
Boto

To set up:
sudo yum install python-pip
sudo pip install -U boto
sudo pip install -U ansible
sudo chmod 500 ec2.py ec2.sh

Also, be sure to define your aws access key id and secret access key using:
aws configure

For Splunk configuration:
Go into playbooks and create a file called splunk_pass.yml and put in the password 
for the default splunk account.
Go into playbooks/config/splunk and create a file called user-seed.conf and put in the 
default splunk username and password. The format is given by user-seed.conf.format.
Encrypt both files with the following command:
ansible-vault encrypt FILENAME
And put in a memorable password. To run splunk related playbooks, use:
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass /path/to/playbook/

A word about integrating Splunk in the CLI for automating blacklist updates:
You will need a Splunk SDK to get search results in the CLI. These can be found here:
https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/downloads/
In the case of this project, the Python SDK was used. This can be obtained using:
git clone https://www.github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-python.git
Remember, you need to have a file called .splunkrc in your home directory which should 
contain the following:
host=localhost
port=8089 (or whatever your deployment port is)
username=(your username)
password=(password for that username)

You will also need to run:
export PYTHONPATH=~/splunk-sdk-python/
Be sure that points to where the splunk sdk directory. Although search.py is included
in this project, you still need to git clone the sdk and export it's path to PYTHONPATH.
